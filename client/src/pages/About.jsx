          Bryan Brown has been an Erie resident for about two and a half years,
          and is no stranger to Boulder County. He is a CU alumni, and has
          always loved the Boulder area. That’s what gave him the idea for the
          name “Boulder Bagels” – “Since attending college in Boulder, I always
          really liked the area, and when I started thinking about my bagel
          business, the name really stuck out to me and conveniently no one
          owned it yet.” This
          east-coast-style-bagel-meets-west-coast-authenticity company has only
          been in business for a few weeks so far, and their product is already
          busting through the doors of Erie residents, with them filling 45
          orders on their opening weekend. “We gained attention very quickly and
          are thrilled with the response from the community. It’s been a lot of
          work, but we are having so much fun building the business.” Since
          then, they have hired a driver to help with delivering to ensure that
          he and his partner can focus on getting everything out the door fresh
          and on-time!
